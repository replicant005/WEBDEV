- id search query is for input that user enters into the search bar
- the part which showcases the result is search results 
- 
in js we make a function , searchContacts , which basically has 

- a variable which stores the value whichhas been entered in search qyuery , so basically whatever has been inputted by the user 
- 

[[ in the search api , i have a variable $query , which stores value for the parmeter passedin the url 
the code for it is as follows: 
$query = $_GET ['query'] ?? '';
so if there is a value in the $_GET array that is considered as a parameter , if there is none it allocates an empty string to the paarameter
