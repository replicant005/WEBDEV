what we did for l1 : 
setting up the express for application 
so express is a js framework which we access from excpress package from node modules downloaded by npm install 
// comands to remember to dowmload packages : 
- mpm init -y (creates package json)
- npm install (downlaods node modules)

we store environmnet variables in .env file and to use it we make a process.env object which gives us access to the partticular variable in env file 


------------------------------------------------------
require('dotenv').config()  - this loads .env variables into process.env object , helps store sensitive data outside the code 

const express = require('express') - exporting the express lib
// express app
const app = express() - declaring an express app, app object is now used to define routes, middleware and staring the server 

// middleware   - middleware function that runs before every request , it takes in 3 parameters request , response , next (next is a function , calling which will make the request move to next piece of middleware or function)
 so this basically is a global middleware, inside this middleware i will add the behavior i want every request to follow , so i console log the request path and request method 
so this is for all requests entering no matter from what route
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.path, req.method)
  next()
})

// routes - here we have another function / route handler to handle when browser makes a get request ,this is basically an api that tells what to do when browser requeests to get the root url or / endpoint, it basically would respond with a json file with the specified text
// this route handler is for / endpoint , ie whenever user is on localhost:4000/ , this will the response to the request made through that rouute or *api endpoint*. 
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({mssg: 'Welcome to the app'})
})

// just like above we could be creating more route handlers or 

// listen for requests
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {
  console.log('listening on port', process.env.PORT)
})
---------------------------------------------------------

API endpoint consists of :
- base url : localhost: 4000
- path / route - /
- http method - get  
** remember : route is a part of api endpoint. 

A route handler is function that runs when a particukar API endpoint is requested.
eg: 
app.http method (path , function that will be ewxecuted when user requests this)
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json([{ id: 1, name: 'mhk' }, { id: 2, name: 'prs' }])
})

Middleware is a function that runs even before requests reach the route handler, it can modify the requests as well . 
// Middleware to log request details
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request: ${req.method} ${req.path}`)
  next() // Moves to the next middleware or route handler
})
